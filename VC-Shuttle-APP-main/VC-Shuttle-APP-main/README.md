Introduction
The goal of the VC Shuttle system is to improve college students' transportation experiences by offering an easy-to-use booking and optimization platform.
The goal, scope, architecture, and salient characteristics of the system are described in this document. Students can attend classes on time by using the VC Shuttle web application to make their commute to and from campus more efficient. 
Students can schedule a shuttle trip from one of three locations—the IIE Varsity College campus, the Benmore shopping center, or the Gautrain station—using the web and mobile applications. 
These are all student hotspots that are close to the campus. Additionally, since they are all in the Sandton region, it is convenient for a shuttle service to run between them. 

Aims and Objectives
⦁	Give college students access to an effective and convenient form of transportation. 
⦁	Simplify the shuttle reservation process by using mobile and web applications.
⦁	Reduce travel expenses and times by streamlining shuttle routes. 
⦁	Provide users with updates in real time. 
⦁	Provide the college administration with necessary reports that include information on ridership, peak hours, and route efficiency. 
⦁	Cross-platform compatibility is necessary to ensure that the mobile and online applications function on all types of devices. 
⦁	To allow for future upgrades if more data must be saved, the system should be built to be scalable. 

Project Description
Features like user registration, shuttle booking, scheduled departures, route optimization, real-time updates, and reporting for college administration will be included in the VC Shuttle Web and Mobile App. 

Functions:

Web Application:
User Registration:
Students can successfully register by making use of their campus issued emails. This is a security feature so that only campus staff and students or anyone that attends the IIE Varsity College may make use of the shuttle service.
 
Authentication:
Ensures users data is protected as well as any data input while making use of the web app.
 
Shuttle Bookings:
Users can book time slots for shuttles at their leisure. 
 
Route Optimization:
Route optimization algorithms will determine the most efficient travel path for the shuttle to take.
 
Real-time Updates:
Users will be notified when shuttles are down, estimated arrival and departure times as well as potential delays.
 
User interface:
Design and implementation of a robust user-friendly and responsive UI for desktop and mobile phones alike.
 
Backend Integration:
Integration with the backend server that stores and retrieves user data.
